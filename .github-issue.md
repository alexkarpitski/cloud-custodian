**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
As a developer working with c7n source code, I have faced the following:
1) inability to reproducibly reflect modules being affected by the changes in others;
2) resources should be written in a proper way so that docs generate well;
3) inconsistent behavior of tests when run altogether vs separately;
4) making OPS team clone the whole fork and install numerous dev packages via pip in order to work with the latest updates.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
[Bazel|https://github.com/alexkarpitski/cloud-custodian/tree/blaze-integration-poc] - fast, correct, integrates well with Github Actions.
1) [bazel test ...|https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#test] runs targets in an isolated manner creating [runfiles|https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/runfiles.html] for each; in addition, bazel tests only the targets affected in [dependency graph|https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/build-ref.html#dependencies], otherwise [cached results|https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--cache_test_results] will be used;
2) [bazel build //tools/c7n_sphinxext/c7n_sphinxext:sphinx_gen|https://github.com/alexkarpitski/cloud-custodian/blob/blaze-integration-poc/.github/workflows/bazel-build-docs.yml]
3) see 1;
4) [bazel build //:c7n_wheel|https://github.com/alexkarpitski/cloud-custodian/blob/blaze-integration-poc/.github/workflows/bazel-build-wheels.yml] produces mainstream [python distribution packages|https://pythonwheels.com/].

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The existing toolkit partly addresses the listed issues:
1-2) `tox` is a fast way for testing locally, however, it does not guarantee reproducibility since packages in virtual environments created by the tool could still interfere with system packages; although there are [pipelines|https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian/actions?query=workflow%3ACI] where VMs with a clean state are used, a PR should be created first to trigger them that not only has a side effect of sending notifications to the owners but also could not be enough due to `tox` behavior itself which is clarified in 3;
3) [test_output|https://github.com/alexkarpitski/cloud-custodian/pull/35/commits/b03192b96ef71b3237f735c7e2faf222a8381abc] and [test_cli|https://github.com/alexkarpitski/cloud-custodian/pull/35/commits/d9a3a2ccb7e346760ef6660a68ff2840e3e57a46] pass when run in `tox` as it keeps already loaded modules in memory, however, once `.tox` configuration is changed to test only these, the failures reproduce due to the lack of configuration made by previously run tests; in other words, the results of tests could be affected by others.

**Additional context**
https://bazel.build/
1) c7n tests are split into chunks as VMs run out of memory

/////
isolation - no need to load external modules (previous design until lazy loading)
caching, dependency graph
reproducible
all-in-one - build wheels, docs, run tests, coverage, write your own (wheels versions)
distribute across organization

interesting, what was this about? tbh, while Bazel is cool, its not mainstream, nor does it provide significant value afaics, frankly it kinda of smells of google NIH. it helps if your test suite is already painful to run en whole, and you don't care about learning curve for external contributors, but we recently got down to ~1m for 2.6k tests, ie. actually fixing improving things is another ready option. if Bazel is of interest, please file an issue to discuss. we just landed several major packaging changes though which address other real world considerations.

tbh, I'm starting to come around to bazel, and its ability to cross address across language and env, tbd. if you want to open an issue that might be a good start if this is something you'd like to see.
